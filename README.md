# MINDSTORMS&reg; Robot Inventor hub API

This repository contains the MicroPython documentation for the LEGO&reg; MINDSTORMS Inventor Hub (set 51515). MicroPython is a small and efficient Python implementation that can run on the LEGO MINDSTORMS Inventor Hub.

The LEGO Group has extended MicroPython with the hub package, which provides access to LEGO motors, sensors, and devices built into the hub.

The documentation can be found here: <https://lego.github.io/MINDSTORMS-Robot-Inventor-hub-API/>

Several standard MicroPython modules are also available on the hub. You can find documentation for those modules in the official [MicroPython](http://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.12/) documentation.
